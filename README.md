AuroraSeek
===========

AuroraSeek is a simple, modular search system scaffold featuring:
- Crawler, Indexer, and Query services in Go
- In-memory BM25 index implementation (placeholder)
- Kafka integration stubs
- Optional Python reranker service
- Protobuf API definitions
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests

This repository is a scaffold to help you get started quickly. Most components are minimal and intended to be extended.

Getting Started
---------------
- Requires: Go 1.21+, Docker (optional), protoc (optional for proto generation), Python 3.10+ (optional for reranker)

Basic commands
--------------
- Build all: `make build`
- Tidy deps: `make tidy`
- Generate proto (needs protoc + protoc-gen-go): `make proto`

Running locally
---------------
- Docker Compose: `docker compose up --build`
- Kubernetes (example manifests): apply files under `k8s/` after pushing images to a registry you control.

Project Layout
--------------
See the directory tree in the issue/request. Key parts:
- `cmd/` entrypoints for services
- `internal/` packages: bm25, kafka, index, util
- `proto/` protobuf API
- `reranker/` Python microservice stub

Notes
-----
- `go.sum` is generated by `go mod tidy` or building.
- The BM25 and index implementations are placeholders to compile; extend as needed.
- Kafka config in `.env.example` should be adjusted to your environment.
